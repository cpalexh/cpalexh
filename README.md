# Hi there! 👋

I'm Alex, a frontend developer who believes in the power of laughter and good code!

## About Me 🚀
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can about React and Vue, because who doesn't love more frameworks?
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make the internet a funnier place.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with understanding why my code works on the second try.
- 💬 Ask me about PHP, JavaScript, HTML, SCSS, CSS, WordPress, and the best coding memes.
- 😄 Pronouns: Axel
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can write a CSS class faster than I can tie my shoes!
